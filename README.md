# 🚦 Traffic Management System Simulation (JavaFX + DSA)

This is a Complex Computing Problem (CCP) project for the **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** course. It simulates an intelligent traffic management system using **JavaFX** and core data structures like **Queue** and **PriorityQueue** to handle normal and emergency vehicles across multiple intersections.
